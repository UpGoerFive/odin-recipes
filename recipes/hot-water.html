    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>My mother's recipe for hot water. She views an evening mug of hot water with same reverence
            as a morning cup of coffee, and decided instructions were needed. Her description follows:</em></p>
        <p>I’ve had a lot of requests for this recipe, but I’m only sharing it because y’all are family.
        While I cannot live without my tea (Yorkshire Gold with milk, please), sometimes I want something simpler and
        dairy-free.
        Hot Water is hydrating, its heat is comforting, and it does not upset my stomach as cold water sometimes does.
        There are those within my own household that mock me, but I know that many of you also enjoy Hot Water and its
        health benefits!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the water in a pot or kettle until it boils. </li>
        <li>Pour into a mug and let cool to 130-160 degrees. (Or don’t boil it first, but it really does taste better having been boiled.)</li>
        <li>Even at 110-120 degrees, the water will be delicious, but you are fast approaching the point where it will no longer be considered Hot Water. It’s just gonna be Water.</li>
    </ol>
